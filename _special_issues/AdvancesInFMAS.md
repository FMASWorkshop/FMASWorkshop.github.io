**Science of Computer Programming** special issue on  **Advances in Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems**

<img alt="FMAS Workshop Logo" style="float: left; margin: 1em" src="{{site.images}}logos/FMAS-Logo.png">



This special issue provides an opportunity for researchers and
practitioners to present theory, techniques, and applications related
to the use of formal methods in the engineering, design, and analysis
of autonomous systems.  Papers within this special issue should
present advances in the field of *Formal Methods for Autonomous
Systems (FMAS)*, whether in specification, verification, or synthesis.

The topics of interest for this special issue match those of the FMAS
workshop, and a variety of other conference venues (e.g. FM, iFM,
SEFM).  Specifically, we are interested in formal methods being
applied to almost any kind of autonomous system.

*Keywords:* formal verification, autonomous systems, robotic systems,
runtime verification, formal specification, assurance methodologies,
environment modelling.

*Final manuscript submission deadline:* **June 7, 2024**

Submission details are being finalised.
