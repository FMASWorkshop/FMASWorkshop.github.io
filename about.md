## Citing FMAS Papers

When a citing paper published in FMAS through the Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) please use the full title of the proceedings, do not cite it as an arXiv paper. Using the BibTex citation from arXiv hides the workshop's name, so it should not be used.

The FMAS proceedings are [index on DBLP](https://dblp.dagstuhl.de/db/conf/fmas/index.html) and the bibtex export from DBLP gives the full proceedings title. This makes it an easy way to cite FMAS papers correctly. For example, the paper _"What to tell when? - Information Provision as a Game"_ by Astrid Rakow, Mehrnoush Hajnorouzi, Akhila Bairy featured in FMAS 2023. To quickly get the correct citation information, you can [export the Bibtex](https://dblp.dagstuhl.de/rec/journals/corr/abs-2311-09776.html?view=bibtex) from DBLP.
