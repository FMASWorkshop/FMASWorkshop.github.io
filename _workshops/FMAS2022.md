FMAS 2022 is a two-day workshop that brings together researchers working on a range of techniques for the formal verification of autonomous systems, to present recent work in the area, discuss key challenges, and stimulate collaboration between autonomous systems and formal methods researchers.

Our twitter account is: [https://twitter.com/FMASWorkshop](https://twitter.com/FMASWorkshop) and posts about this year's workshop use the tag [#FMAS2022](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FMAS2022?src=hashtag_click)

Autonomous systems present unique challenges for formal methods. They are often embodied in robotic systems that can interact with the real world, and they make independent decisions. Amongst other categories, they can be viewed as safety-critical, cyber-physical, hybrid, and real-time systems.

Key challenges for applying formal methods to autonomous systems include:
* the system's dynamic deployment environment;
* verifying the system's decision making capabilities -- including planning, ethical, and reconfiguration choices; and
* using formal methods results as evidence given to certification or regulatory organisations.

FMAS welcomes submissions that use formal methods to specify, model, or verify autonomous systems; in whole or in part. We are especially interested in work using integrated formal methods, where multiple (formal or non-formal) methods are combined during the software engineering process.

Autonomous systems are often embedded in robotic or cyber-physical systems, and they share many features (and verification challenges) with automated systems. FMAS welcomes submissions with applications to:
* automated systems,
* semi-autonomous systems, or
* fully-autonomous systems.

### Topics

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Novel or Integrated Formal Methods that are suited to Autonomous or Automated Systems,
* Runtime Verification or other formal approaches to deal with the _reality gap_ (the gap between models/simulations and the real world),
* Verification against safety assurance arguments or standards documents,
* Formal specification and requirements engineering approaches for autonomous systems,
* Case Studies that identify challenges when applying formal methods to autonomous systems,
* Experience Reports that provide guidance for tackling challenges with formal methods or tools, or
* Discussions of the future directions of the field.

Because the above list is not exhaustive, if you are unsure if your paper is in scope for FMAS  please feel free to email us (details below) to discuss it.

## Submission and Publication

Please submit your paper via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmas2022](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fmas2022).

There are four categories of submission:

* **Vision papers**  *6 pages (excluding references)* describe directions for research into Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems;
* **Research previews**  *6 pages (excluding references)* describe well-defined research ideas that are in their early stages, and my not be fully developed yet. Work from PhD students is particularly welcome;
* **Experience report papers** *15 pages (excluding references)* report on practical experiences in applying Formal Methods to Autonomous Systems, focussing on the experience and lessons to be learnt;
* **Regular papers** *15 pages (excluding references)* describe completed applications of Formal Methods to an Autonomous System, new or improved approaches, evaluations of existing approaches, and so on.

These categories are intended to help you show your intent for your paper, and to allow a fairer comparison of papers. For example, a Research Preview wont be judged as not developed enough for acceptance, just because it is being compared to a Standard Paper. The category descriptions are not exhaustive and should be interpreted broadly. If you are unsure if your paper clearly fits into one of these categories, please feel free to email us (details below) to discuss it.

Submission will be via easychair; submissions must be prepared using the [EPTCS LaTeX style](http://style.eptcs.org/). Each submission will receive at least three, single-blind reviews. If a paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present their work. We intend that accepted papers will be published via [EPTCS](http://www.eptcs.org/).

## Important Dates

* **Submission: {{site.data.fmas2022.dates.submission}} ([AOE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe))**
* Notification: {{site.data.fmas2022.dates.notification}}
* Final Version due: {{site.data.fmas2022.dates.final_version}}
* Workshop: {{site.data.fmas2022.dates.workshop}}


## Venue

FMAS 2022 will be held on the 26th and 27th of September 2022, co-located with the [International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM) 2022](https://sefm-conference.github.io/2022/), hosted by Humboldt University, Berlin.

We will accept participation in-person and remotely:
* At least one author per paper must register for FMAS through the [SEFM registration system](https://sefm-conference.github.io/2022/registration.html),
even if the paper will be presented remotely -- this is to ensure we cover the costs of running FMAS as a satellite workshop at SEFM.
* Those participating remotely should register via [eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fourth-workshop-on-formal-methods-for-autonomous-systems-tickets-416837992657) to obtain the zoom link for FMAS 2022.

FMAS 2022 is able to reimburse the registration fee for FMAS and SEFM for authors who are currently students. This is possible thanks to sponsorship by the [Formal Methods Europe](https://www.fmeurope.org/) association.
