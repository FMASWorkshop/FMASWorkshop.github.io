FMAS 2021 is a one-day workshop that brings together researchers working on a range of techniques for the formal verification of autonomous systems, to present recent work in the area, discuss key challenges, and stimulate collaboration between autonomous systems and formal methods researchers.

FMAS 2021 will be an online event, with the possibility of being a hybrid event if COVID-19 restrictions allow. The decision between hybrid and purely online will be made on the author notification date (see [Important Dates](#important-dates)).

## Scope

Autonomous Systems present unique challenges for formal methods. They are often embodied in robotic systems that can interact with the real world, and they make independent decisions. Amongst other categories, they can be viewed as safety-critical, cyber-physical, hybrid, and real-time systems.

Key challenges for applying formal methods to autonomous systems include:
* the system's dynamic deployment environment;
* verifying the system's decision making capabilities -- including planning, ethical, and reconfiguration choices; and
* using formal methods results as evidence given to certification or regulatory organisations.

FMAS welcomes submissions that use formal methods to specify, model, or verify autonomous systems; in whole or in part. We are especially interested in work using Integrated Formal Methods, where multiple (formal or non-formal) methods are combined.

Autonomous systems are often embedded in robotic or cyber-physical systems, and they share many features (and verification challenges) with automated systems. FMAS welcomes submissions with applications to:
* automated systems,
* semi-autonomous systems,
* fully-autonomous systems, or
* systems that have the potential to be autonomous in the future.

### Topics

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Novel or Integrated Formal Methods that are suited to Autonomous or Automated Systems,
* Runtime Verification or other formal approaches to deal with the _reality gap_ (the gap between models/simulations and the real world),
* Verification against safety assurance arguments or standards documents,
* Case Studies that identify challenges when applying formal methods to autonomous systems,
* Experience Reports that provide guidance for tackling challenges with formal methods or tools, or
* Discussions of the future directions of the field.

## Submission and Publication

There are two categories of submission:

* **Short papers -- 6 pages (excluding references)**, suitable for overviews of an approach or work-in-progress. Work from PhD students is particularly welcome;
* **Long papers -- 15 pages (excluding references)**, suitable for descriptions of completed studies, new approaches, or new directions.

Submission will be via [easychair]({{site.data.fmas2021.easychair}}); FMAS has a single track that accepts both categories of submission. Submissions must be prepared using the [EPTCS LaTeX style](http://style.eptcs.org/).

Each submission will receive at least three, single-blind reviews. If a paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present their work. We intend that accepted papers will be published via [EPTCS](http://www.eptcs.org/).

## Important Dates

* **Submission: {{site.data.fmas2021.dates.submission}} ([AOE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe))**
* Notification: {{site.data.fmas2021.dates.notification}}
* Final Version due: {{site.data.fmas2021.dates.final_version}}
* Workshop: {{site.data.fmas2021.dates.workshop}}


## Registration

FMAS 2021 will be held **online** via a video conference system. We will circulate details closer to the event, when the number of attendees is clearer. If a hybrid event is possible, the venue for physical participants will be Maynooth University, Ireland.
