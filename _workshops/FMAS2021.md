FMAS is a one-day academic workshop that brings together researchers working on a range of techniques for the formal verification or autonomous systems, to present recent work in the area, discuss key challenges, and stimulate collaboration between autonomous systems and formal methods researchers.

FMAS 2021 will be an online event, with the possibility of being a hybrid event if COVID-19 restrictions allow. The decision between hybrid and purely online will be made on the Notification date (see [Important Dates](#important-dates)).

## Scope

Autonomous Systems present unique challenges for formal methods. They are often embodied in robotic systems that can interact with the real world, and they make independent decisions. Amongst other categories, they can be viewed as safety-critical, cyber-physical, hybrid, and real-time systems.

Key challenges for applying formal methods to autonomous systems include:
* the system's dynamic deployment environment;
* verifying the system's decision making capabilities -- including planning, ethical, and reconfiguration choices; and
* using formal methods results as evidence given to certification or regulatory organisations.

FMAS welcomes submissions that use formal methods to specify, model, or verify autonomous systems; in whole or in part. We are especially interested in work using Integrated Formal Methods, where multiple (formal or non-formal) methods are combined.

Autonomous systems are often embedded in robotic systems, and they share many features (and verification challenges) with automated systems. FMAS welcomes submissions where they example application is:
* automated,
* semi-autonomous,
* fully-autonomous, or
* has the potential to be autonomous.

### Topics

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* Novel or Integrated Formal Methods work that are suited to Autonomous or Automated Systems,
* Runtime Verification or other approaches to deal with the _reality gap_,
* Verification against safety assurance arguments or standards documents,
* Case Studies that identify challenges when applying formal methods to autonomous systems,
* Experience Reports that provide guidance for tackling challenges with formal methods or tools, or
* Discussions of the future directions of the field.

## Submission and Publication


There are two categories of submission:

* **Short papers -- 6 pages (excluding references)**, suitable for overviews of an approach or work-in-progress. Work from PhD students is particularly welcome;
* **Long papers -- 15 pages (excluding references)**, suitable for descriptions of completed studies, new approaches, or new directions.

Submission will be via [easychair](); FMAS has a single track that accepts both categories of submission). Submissions must be prepared using the [EPTCS LaTeX style](http://style.eptcs.org/).

Each submission will receive at least three, single-blind reviews. If a paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must attend the workshop to present their work. Accepted papers will be published via [EPTCS](http://www.eptcs.org/).

## Important Dates

* **Submission:  ([AOE](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe))**
* Notification:
* Final Version due:
* Workshop: 28th of November 2021


## Registration

FMAS 2021 will be held **online** via a video conference system. We will circulate details closer to the event, when the number of attendees is clearer.

You can register to attend FMAS 2021, for **free**, using our [eventbrite]() page.
