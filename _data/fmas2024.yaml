### TALKS ###

  - name: "Dr Silvia Lizeth Tapia Tarifa"

    link: "https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/personer/vit/sltarifa/"
    title: "Self-Adaptation in Autonomous Systems"
    abstract: "Self-adaptation is a crucial feature of autonomous systems that must cope with uncertainties in, e.g., their environment and their internal state. A self-adaptive system (SAS) can be realised as a multi-layered system, e.g., a two-layered systems that have a separation of concerns between the domain-specific functionalities of the system (the managed subsystem) and the adaptation logic (the managing subsystem), which introduces an external feedback loop for managing adaptation in the system; or as a three-layered system, where the third layer can implement a feedback loop for architectural self-adaptation, which is used to reconfigure the second layer (the adaptation logic of the managing subsystem). In this talk I will present techniques that can capture the SAS’s variability, concretely software product lines, where the managing subsystem of an SAS can be modelled as a control layer capable of dynamically switching between valid configurations of the managed subsystem; and declarative stages in a lifecycle of a system, where we do not require explicit modelling of the transitions between stages in the lifecycles of a system; however, characteristics on an stage can be observed, which after observation may trigger changes in the self-adaptation logic itself.

    title: "Proof for Industrial Systems using Neural Certificates"
    abstract: "We introduce a novel approach to model checking software and hardware that combines machine learning and symbolic reasoning by using neural networks as formal proof certificates. We train our neural certificates from randomly generated executions of the system and we then symbolically check their validity which, upon the affirmative answer, establishes that the system provably satisfies the specification. We leverage the expressive power of neural networks to represent proof certificates and the fact that checking a certificate is much simpler than finding one. As a result, our machine learning procedure is entirely unsupervised, formally sound, and practically effective. We implemented a prototype and compared the performance of our method with the state-of-the-art academic and commercial model checkers on a set of Java programs and hardware designs written in SystemVerilog."

papers:
  - title: "RV4Chatbot: Are Chatbots Allowed to Dream of Electric Sheep?"
    authors: "Andrea Gatti, Viviana Mascardi, and Angelo Ferrando"
    abstract: "Chatbots have become integral to various application
domains, including those with safety-critical
considerations. As a result, there is a pressing need for
methods that ensure chatbots consistently adhere to
expected, safe behaviours. In this paper, we introduce
RV4Chatbot, a Runtime Verification framework designed to
monitor deviations in chatbot behaviour. We formalise
expected behaviours as interaction protocols between the
user and the chatbot. We present the RV4Chatbot design and
describe two implementations that instantiate it: RV4Rasa,
for monitoring chatbots created with the Rasa framework,
and RV4Dialogflow, for monitoring Dialogflow chatbots.
Additionally, we detail experiments conducted in a factory
automation scenario using both RV4Rasa and RV4Dialogflow."

  - title: "Autonomous System Safety Properties with Multi-Machine Hybrid Event-B"
    authors: "Richard Banach"
    abstract: "Event-B is a well known methodology for the verified design
and development
of systems that can be characterised as discrete transition
systems. Hybrid
Event-B is a conservative extension that interleaves the
discrete transitions
of Event-B (assumed to be temporally isolated) with
episodes of continuously
varying state change. While a single Hybrid Event-B machine
is sufficient for
applications with a single locus of control, it will not do
for autonomous
systems, which have several loci of control by default.
Multi-machine Hybrid
Event-B is designed to allow the specification of systems
with several loci
of control. The formalism is succinctly surveyed, pointing
out the subtle
semantic issues involved. The multi-machine formalism is
then used to specify
a relatively simple incident response system, involving a
controller, two
drones and three responders, working in a partly
coordinated and partly
independent fashion to manage a putative hazardous scenario."

  - title: "Model Checking for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving: One Can Do More Than You Think!"
    authors: "Rong Gu"
    abstract: "Most reinforcement learning (RL) platforms use high-level
programming languages, such as OpenAI Gymnasium using
Python. These frameworks provide various API and benchmarks
for testing RL algorithms in different domains, such as
autonomous driving (AD) and robotics. These platforms often
emphasise the design of RL algorithms and the training
performance but neglect the correctness of models and
reward functions, which can be crucial for the successful
application of RL. This paper proposes using formal methods
to model AD systems and demonstrates how model checking
(MC) can be used in RL for AD. Most studies combining MC
and RL focus on safety, such as safety shields. However,
this paper shows different facets where MC can strengthen
RL. First, an MC-based model pre-analysis can reveal bugs
with respect to sensor accuracy and learning step size.
This step serves as a preparation of RL, which saves time
if bugs exist and deepens users' understanding of the
target system. Second, reward automata can greatly improve
learning performance especially when the learning
objectives are multiple. All these findings are supported
by experiments."

  - title: "Open Challenges in the Formal Verification of Autonomous Driving"
    authors: "Paolo Burgio, Angelo Ferrando, and Marco Villani"
    abstract: "In the realm of autonomous driving, the development and
integration of highly complex and heterogeneous systems are
standard practice. Modern vehicles are not monolithic
systems; instead, they are composed of diverse hardware
components, each running its own software systems. An
autonomous vehicle comprises numerous independent
components, often developed by different and potentially
competing companies. This diversity poses significant
challenges for the certification process, as it
necessitates certifying components that may not disclose
their internal behaviour (black-boxes). In this paper, we
present a real-world case study of an autonomous driving
system, identify key open challenges associated with its
development and integration, and explore how formal
verification techniques can address these challenges to
ensure system reliability and safety."

  - title: "ROSMonitoring 2.0: Extending ROS Runtime Verification to Services and Ordered Topics"
    authors: "Maryam Ghaffari Saadat, Angelo Ferrando, Louise A. Dennis, and Michael Fisher"
    abstract: "Formal verification of robotic applications presents
challenges due to their hybrid nature and distributed
architecture. This paper introduces ROSMonitoring 2.0, an
extension of ROSMonitoring designed to facilitate the
monitoring of both topics and services while considering
the order in which messages are published and received. The
framework has been enhanced to support these novel features
for both ROS1 and ROS2 environments, offering improved
real-time support, security, scalability, and
interoperability. We discuss the modifications made to
accommodate these advancements and present results obtained
from a case study involving the runtime monitoring of
specific components of a fire-fighting Uncrewed Aerial
Vehicle (UAV)."

  - title: "Cross-layer Formal Verification of Robotic Systems"
    authors: "Sylvain Raïs, Julien Brunel, David Doose, and Frédéric Herbreteau"
    abstract: "The design and verification of robotic systems are often
divided into several layers for reasons of system
modularity and complexity. However, some system properties
can only be studied by considering several layers
simultaneously. We propose a cross-layer verification
method to check the expected properties of concrete robotic
systems. Our method verifies a layer using abstractions of
other layers. We propose two approaches: refining the
models of the abstract layers and refining the property
under verification. A combination of these two approaches
seems the most promising to ensure model genericity and
avoid the problem of state-space explosion."

  - title: "Using Formal Models, Safety Shields and Certified Control to Validate AI-Based Train Systems"
    authors: "Jan Gruteser, Jan Roßbach, Fabian Vu and Michael Leuschel"
    abstract: "The certification of autonomous systems is an important
concern in science and industry. The KI- LOK project
explores new methods for certifying and safely integrating
AI components into autonomous trains. We pursued a
two-layered approach: (1) ensuring the safety of the
steering system by formal analysis using the B method, and
(2) improving the reliability of the perception system with
a runtime certificate checker. This work links both
strategies within a demonstrator that runs simulations on
the formal model, controlled by the real AI output and the
real certificate checker. The demonstrator is integrated
into the formal method tool PROB. This enables runtime
monitoring, runtime verification, and statistical
validation of formal safety properties using a formal B
model. Consequently, one can detect and analyse potential
vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the AI and the
certificate checker. We apply these techniques to a signal
detection case study, demonstrating the effectiveness and
presenting initial findings."

  - title: "A Case Study on Numerical Analysis of a Path Computation Algorithm"
    authors: "Grégoire Boussu, Nikolai Kosmatov and Franck Vedrine"
    abstract: "Lack of numerical precision in control software --- in
particular,
related to trajectory computation --- can lead to
incorrect results with costly or even catastrophic
consequences.
Various tools have been proposed to analyze the precision
of program computations.
This paper presents a case study on numerical analysis of
an industrial
implementation of the fast marching algorithm,  a popular
path computation algorithm
frequently used for trajectory computation.
We briefly describe the selected tools, present the applied
methodology,
highlight some attention points, summarize the results and
outline
future work directions."

  - title: "Synthesising Robust Controllers for Robot Collectives with Recurrent Tasks: A Case Study"
    authors: "Till Schnittka and Mario Gleirscher"
    abstract: "When designing correct-by-construction controllers for
autonomous collectives, three key challenges are the task
specification, the modelling, and its use at practical
scale. In this paper, we focus on a simple yet useful
abstraction for high-level controller synthesis for robot
collectives with optimisation goals (e.g., maximum
cleanliness, minimum energy consumption) as well as
recurrence (e.g., maintain a contamination threshold, avoid
running out of charge) and safety (e.g., mutually exclusive
room occupation) constraints.

Due to technical limitations (related to scalability and
using constraints in the synthesis), we simplify a
graph-based setting using stochastic two-player games into
a single-player game on partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). Robustness against
environmental uncertainty is encoded via partial
observability. Linear-time correctness properties are
verified separately after synthesising the POMDP strategy.

We contribute at-scale guidance on POMDP modelling and
controller synthesis for tasked robot collectives
exemplified by the scenario of battery-driven robots
responsible for cleaning public buildings with utilisation
constraints"

  - title: "Model checking and verification of synchronisation properties of cobot welding"
    authors: "Yvonne Murray, Henrik Nordlie, David A. Anisi, Pedro Ribeiro and Ana Cavalcanti"
    abstract: "This work describes use of model checking to verify
synchronisation properties of an industrial welding system
consisting of a cobot arm and an external turntable. The
robots move synchronously, but sometimes get out of
synchronisation. This gives inadequate weld qualities in
problem areas, such as around corners. These mistakes are
costly, since time is lost both in the robotic welding and
in manual repairs needed to improve the weld. Verification
of the synchronisation properties showed that they were
fulfilled as long as assumptions of correctness were made
about parts outside the scope of the model, indicating
limitations in the hardware. These results motivated a
re-calibration of the real-life system, drastically
improving the welding results."

  - title: "Formal simulation and visualisation of hybrid programs"
    authors: "Pedro Mendes, Ricardo Correia, Renato Neves and José Proença"
    abstract: "The design and analysis of systems that combine
computational, discrete behaviour with physical processes'
continuous dynamics – such as movement, velocity, and
voltage – is a famous, challenging task. Several
theoretical results from programming theory emerged in the
last decades to tackle the issue; some of which are the
basis of a proof-of-concept tool, called Lince, that aids
in the analysis of such systems, by presenting simulations
of their respective behaviours.

Being a proof-of-concept, the tool is quite limited w.r.t.
usability, and when attempting to apply it to a set of
common, concrete problems, involving autonomous driving and
others, it either simply cannot simulate them or fails to
provide a satisfactory user-experience.

This work thus complements the aforementioned theoretical
approaches with a more practical perspective by improving
Lince along several dimensions: to name a few, richer
syntactic constructs, more operations, more informative
plotting systems and errors messages, and a better
performance overall. We illustrate our improvements via
small different case-studies that involve both autonomous
driving and electrical systems."

  - title: "Formalizing Stateful Behavior Trees"
    authors: "Serena Serbinowska, Preston Robinette, Gabor Karsai and Taylor T Johnson"
    abstract: "Behavior Trees (BTs) are high-level controllers that are
useful in a variety of planning tasks and are gaining
traction in robotic mission planning. As they gain
popularity in safety-critical domains, it is important to
formalize their syntax and semantics, as well as verify
properties for them. In this paper, we formalize a class of
BTs we call Stateful Behavior Trees (SBTs) that have
auxiliary variables and operate in an environment that can
change over time. SBTs have access to persistent shared
memory—often known as a blackboard—that keeps track of
these auxiliary variables. We demonstrate that SBTs are
equivalent in computational power to Turing Machines when
the blackboard can store mathematical (unbounded) integers.
We also identify conditions where SBTs have computational
power equivalent to finite state automata, specifically
where the auxiliary variables are of finitary types. We
present a domain specific language (DSL) for writing SBTs
and adapt the tool BehaVerify for use with this DSL. This
new DSL in BehaVerify supports interfacing with popular BT
libraries in
Python, and also provides generation of Haskell code and
nuXmv models, the latter of which are used for model
checking temporal logic specifications for the SBTs. We
include examples and scalability results where BehaVerify
outperforms another verification tool (MoVe4BT) by a factor
of 100."

  - title: "Creating a Formally Verified Neural Network for Autonomous
Navigation: An Experience Report"
    authors: "Syed Ali Asadullah Bukhari, Thomas Flinkow, Medet Inkarbekov, Barak A. Pearlmutter and Rosemary Monahan"
    abstract: "The increased reliance of self-driving vehicles on neural
networks opens up the challenge of their verification.
In this paper we present an experience report, describing a
case study which we undertook to explore the design and
training of a neural network on a custom dataset for
vision-based autonomous navigation.
We are particularly interested in the use of machine
learning with differentiable logics to obtain networks
satisfying basic safety properties by design, guaranteeing
the behaviour of the neural network after training.
We motivate the choice of a suitable neural network
verifier for our purposes and report our observations on
the use of neural network verifiers for self-driving
systems."

  - title: "Verification of Behavior Trees with Contingency Monitors"
    authors: "Serena Serbinowska, Nicholas Potteiger, Anne Tumlin and Taylor T Johnson"
    abstract: "Behavior Trees (BTs) are high level controllers that have
found use in a wide range of robotics tasks. As they grow
in popularity and usage, it is crucial to ensure that the
appropriate tools and methods are available for ensuring
they work as intended. To that end, we created a new
methodology by which to create Runtime Monitors for BTs.
These monitors can be used by the BT to correct when
undesirable behavior is detected and are capable of
handling LTL specifications. We demonstrate that in terms
of runtime, the generated monitors are on par with monitors
generated by existing tools and highlight certain features
that make our method more desirable in various situations.
We note that our method allows for our monitors to be
swapped out with alternate monitors with fairly minimal
user effort. Finally, our method ties in with our existing
tool, BehaVerify, allowing for the verification of BTs with
monitors."
