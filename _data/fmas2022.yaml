  - name: Taylor T. Johnson
    bio: "Associate Professor of Computer Science (CS) in the School of Engineering (VUSE) at Vanderbilt University, where he directs the Verification and Validation for Intelligent and Trustworthy Autonomy Laboratory (VeriVITAL) and is a Senior Research Scientist in the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS). Dr. Johnson earned a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2013, where he worked in the Coordinated Science Laboratory with Prof. Sayan Mitra, and earlier earned an MSc in ECE at Illinois in 2010 and a BSEE from Rice University in 2008. Dr. Johnson is a 2018 and 2016 recipient of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investigator Program (YIP) award, a 2016 recipient of the ACM Best Software Repeatability Award at HSCC, a 2015 recipient of the National Science Foundation (NSF) Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Research Initiation Initiative (CRII), and his group's research is / has been supported by AFOSR, ARO, AFRL, DARPA, Mathworks, NSA, NSF, NVIDIA, ONR, Toyota, and USDOT."

    title: "Formal Verification for Neural Networks in Autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems"
    abstract: "The ongoing renaissance in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the advent of data-driven machine learning (ML) methods deployed within components for sensing, actuation, and control in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). While such learning-enabled components (LECs) are enabling autonomy in systems like autonomous vehicles, robots, and other autonomous CPS, as demonstrated in part through recent accidents in semi-autonomous/autonomous CPS and by adversarial ML attacks, ensuring such components operate reliably in all scenarios is extraordinarily challenging. We will discuss formal methods for assuring specifications---mostly robustness and safety---in autonomous CPS using our software tools NNV (Neural Network Verification: https://github.com/verivital/nnv) and Veritex (https://github.com/verivital/veritex), developed as part of an ongoing DARPA Assured Autonomy project. These tools have been evaluated in CPS development with multiple industry partners in automotive, aerospace, and robotics domains, and allow for analyzing neural networks and their usage in closed-loop systems. We will briefly discuss relevant ongoing community activities we help organize, such as the Verification of Neural Networks Competition (VNN-COMP) held with CAV the past few years, as well as the AI and Neural Network Control Systems (AINNCS) category of the hybrid systems verification competition (ARCH-COMP). We will conclude with a discussion of future directions in the broader safe and trustworthy AI domain, such as in new projects verifying neural networks used in medical imaging analysis.
